# Storage Autonomous Agents

This project has a server that runs a simulation (`/server`) and
passes messages to a Unity 3D Simulation that allows us to see this
simulation in real time.

The Unity simulation is located in `/unity`. To see the simulation,
first run the server by looking at the `/server/README.md` file, and
then open the Unity project in Unity 3D, and press play.

## Simulation stats

The simulation provides some graphs that show the stats of the simulation
at the end of the simulation.
